## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- uv package manager (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tc_ds_and_algorithms_2025.git
cd tc_ds_and_algorithms_2025
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
